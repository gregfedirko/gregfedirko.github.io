title: JSFest Oakland 2014
---
Last week I was lucky enough to be able to attend JSFest Oakland 2014.  Basically this was a week-long JavaScript conference hosted in The New Parkway Theater.  I got to meet a bunch of members of the JavaScript community and listen to presentations by some incredible programmers.

### Some of the talks I saw were on topics including:

* ### [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
* ### The Node Way
* ### JavaScript Animations
* ### [Dat](http://dat-data.com/)
* ### Monkey Patching
* ### [Nodebots](http://nodebots.io/)
* ### Getting Involved in the Open Source Community

All in all it was a great experience and I will definitely be attending next year.
