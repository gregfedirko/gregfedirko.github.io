title: Low-poly Self Portrait
---

A couple months ago I purchased Affinity Designer, a fairly recent competitor to Adobe Illustrator.  I have to say... I absolutely love it.  The software is fast, intuitive, and an overall joy to work with.  So far I have used it for UI mockups, Logo Design, and some Artwork I made for fun.  One piece that I am particularly proud of is a low-poly self portrait.  Each shape was drawn by hand.
