title: Graphic Design With Affinity Designer
---

A couple months ago I downloaded Affinity Designer, a fairly recent competitor to Adobe Illustrator.  I have to say... I absolutely love it.  The software is fast, intuitive, and an overall joy to work with.  So far I have used it for UI mockups, Logo Design, and some Artwork I made for fun.  Here are a few of my recent projects.

## Low Poly Self Portrait

## Gridhub Logo

## KeyDash Design Elements
